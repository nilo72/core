Feature: remove a user from a group
  As an admin
  I want to be able to remove a user from a group
  So that I can manage user access to group resources

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: admin removes a user from a group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes
    And group "<group_id>" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id>"
    When the administrator removes user "brand-new-user" from group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not belong to group "<group_id>"
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                     |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here        |
      | España      | special European characters |
      | नेपाली      | Unicode group name          |

Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |
      | user3    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "user1" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "user2" has been added to group "grp1"

    Given user "user3" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with group "grp1" using the webUI
    And the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared with "grp1" by "User Three" on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be marked as shared with "grp1" by "User Three" on the webUI
    When the user re-logs in as "user2" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared with "grp1" by "User Three" on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be listed on the webUI

  Scenario: share a file with an internal group a member overwrites and unshares the file
    Given user "user3" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user renames file "lorem.txt" to "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "new-lorem.txt" with group "grp1" using the webUI
    And the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    Then the content of "new-lorem.txt" should not be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
		# overwrite the received shared file
    When the user uploads overwriting file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
    Then file "new-lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI

		# unshare the received shared file
    When the user unshares file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI

    When the user re-logs in as "user2" using the webUI
    Then the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
		# check that the original file owner can still see the file
    When the user re-logs in as "user3" using the webUI
    Then the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
